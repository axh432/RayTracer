 Specification:
 
 - ./raytracer. There needs to be a scene.txt file in the current directory where the program sits else it will through an error.
 
 - ./raytracer -f some/path/scene.txt then there needs to be a scene.txt file in the path that we have just provided else we will through an error.
 
 - ./raytracer -o some/path/ if this path does not exist then we create it. We also need permissions to write to the path else we will through an error.
